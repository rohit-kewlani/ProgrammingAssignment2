## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and their may be some benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than compute it repeatedly (there are also alternatives to matrix inversion that we will not discuss here). Your assignment is to write a pair of functions that cache the inverse of a matrix.

## Write the following functions:

## makeCacheMatrix: This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.
## cacheSolve: This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed), then the cachesolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

## Initiatilizing the matrix

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

        i <- NULL
        set <- function(y) {
                x <<- y
                i <<- NULL
        }
        get <- function() x
        setinverse <- function(inverse) i <<- inverse
        getinverse <- function() i
        list(set = set, get = get,
             setinverse = setinverse,
             getinverse = getinverse)

}


## Function to return the inverse Matrix post checking for a cached copy (in case it's already been computed or compute fresh)

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
  ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
  i <- x$getinverse()
  if(!is.null(i)) {
    message("getting cached data")
    return(i)
  }
  data <- x$get()
  i <- solve(data, ...)
  x$setinverse(i)
  i
}



##Example for inversion of a 3x3 matrix
x=makeCacheMatrix(matrix(rnorm(9),3,3))
cacheSolve(x)
